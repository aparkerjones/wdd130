        <p>Idaho is a state in the Pacific Northwest known for its rugged natural beauty and abundant outdoor recreation
            opportunities. Nicknamed the "Gem State" due to its rich mineral deposits, Idaho is dominated by the Rocky
            Mountains,
            which contribute to its dramatic landscapes of mountains, rivers, lakes, and Hells Canyon, the deepest river
            gorge in
            North America. Idaho's economy has a strong foundation in agriculture—it produces nearly one-third of the
            nation's
            potatoes—but also relies heavily on manufacturing, technology, tourism, and forestry. The capital and
            largest city is
            Boise, which has grown into a hub for technology and culture, balancing the state's otherwise rural
            character and strong
            frontier heritage</p>
