        <p>Hello, my name is Parker Jones, I am from Idaho and I work at Micron Technology. I am studying to complete a
            Software Development Bachelor's degree. I am doing this with the purpose of advancing my career with the
            hope of owning a home for my family someday. I served a mission in Mexico back in 2015 and my favorites
            temples can be seen with the following links</p>

        <p>Idaho is a state in the Pacific Northwest known for its rugged natural beauty and abundant outdoor recreation
            opportunities. Nicknamed the "Gem State" due to its rich mineral deposits, Idaho is dominated by the Rocky
            Mountains,
            which contribute to its dramatic landscapes of mountains, rivers, lakes, and Hells Canyon, the deepest river
            gorge in
            North America. The highest peak in Idaho is Mount Borah pictured above. Idaho's economy has a strong
            foundation in agriculture—it produces nearly one-third of the
            nation's
            potatoes—but also relies heavily on manufacturing, technology, tourism, and forestry. The capital and
            largest city is
            Boise, which has grown into a hub for technology and culture, balancing the state's otherwise rural
            character and strong
            frontier heritage</p>
