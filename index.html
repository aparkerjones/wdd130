        <p>Utah is a state in the western United States. It is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the
            northeast,
            Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in
            the
            southeast. The state is a center of transportation, education, information technology, and research, and a
            major
            tourist destination for outdoor recreation. Salt Lake City, the state capital and largest city, is home to
            the
            headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).</p>
