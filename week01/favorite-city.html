    <h1> Boise is my Favorite City</h1>
    <p> Boise is the Capitol of Idaho and my hometown. One thing I love about Boise is how it is surrounded by the
        outdoors. Fishing in the rivers and 4-wheeling in the mountains are some of my favorite pastimes. I do however
        miss the small town, rural feel that Boise had for so many years, which has since been replaced by a bustling
        metropolitan area. </p>
